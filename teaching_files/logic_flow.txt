setup code, etc...
- create players
- set the initial game/player state
    - the game starts paused
    - the key bindings are x1, x2, x3
- set the window title

    a. update the frame.
    b. listen for keyboard events.
        - Define what to do on what events
            - turn 90 deg left
            - turn 90 deg right
            - start/resume game

        e. check for intersections.
            if true, break out of loop
                - Must know each x, y coordinate
                of every 90 deg turn.
                - Must know current x, y coordinate
        f. check for out of bounds.
            if true, break out of loop
end of infinite loop
